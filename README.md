# SC4000-Machine-Learning

This report aims to provide a robust predictive model to predict the health outcome of horses in the
Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 22 competition. We experimented with well-known
machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM,
HistGradientBoosting, and CatBoost along with ensembling techniques such as stacking, to
leverage the strengths of individual models. The performances of these model architectures were
accessed in Kaggle to retrieve the official public leaderboard rankings and scores. Finally, to
conclude the report, further insights on the evaluation of the effectiveness of different machine
learning and ensembling architectures.
